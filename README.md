Purpose:
I have developed this project to address the growing concern of online security in todayâ€™s digital landscape. With cyber threats on the rise, many individuals struggle to create strong, unique passwords for their accounts. The Password Checker aims to educate users about password best practices by providing them with tools to evaluate and enhance their password strength.

By promoting the importance of secure passwords, I hope to encourage better security habits that protect personal information from unauthorized access. The application not only serves as a practical tool for assessing password strength but also as an educational resource, equipping users with the knowledge they need to safeguard their online identities effectively.
